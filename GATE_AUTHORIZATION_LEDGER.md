## 2. Gate Decision Notes & Operating Boundaries

1. **Gate M0 (Quarantine & Environment Isolation)**:
   - Approved operating under strict read-only salvage inspection.
   - Live broker/exchange APIs prohibited; mock and loopback transports only.

2. **Gate M1 (Design Readiness Specification Freeze)**:
   - Specification frozen as authoritative normative contract.
   - Embedded errata addressed under versioned addendum / Erratum v1.14 (unifying gateway digest binding to full `ClaimSigningPayload` SHA-256 and fail-closed key validation).

3. **Gate M2 (Simulated Execution & Dual-Ledger Isolation)**:
   - Paper execution pipeline operational with monotonic virtual clocks.
   - `ActualsGuard` enforced fail-closed (`E-ERR-020` and `E-ERR-025`).

4. **Gate M3 (Persistence, Crash Recovery & Native PostgreSQL Concurrency)**:
   - Separate-process crash worker restarts validated against WAL and snapshot storage.
   - Real PostgreSQL 16.8 server verification completed on `localhost:5432` with zero skips across all 6 test cases in Suite 17.
   - WAL boundary normalization, fail-closed torn-tail truncation, and single-pass fill recovery integrated and verified.
